## Task Requirements
This is an open-ended task, and you will discuss your solution in a follow-up 
interview. 

The provided boilerplate application renders a 
"shopping list" on the screen as a nested accordion component and static 
data is loaded to mock data fetching.

The current implementation of this accordion component may be considered 
less than ideal. 

**Your task is to refactor the relevant code, such that the 
accordion component is generic, extensible, and follows typical "best 
practice" patterns in React, while exhibiting the same end-user behaviour.**

### The following tips are provided as focus areas:
- Recursion
- Componentising relevant code
- Making the relevant components "stateful" or "stateless"
- Passing appropriate props, such as callback functions

_Note that no visual changes are required for this task._
